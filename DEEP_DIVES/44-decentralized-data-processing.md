# Decentralized Data Processing

We have the means to store data in a decentralized way. Yet still a lot of decisions to be made when it comes to processing it. Letâ€™s start by pointing out and discussing some of them:

- Should we process the data on a client or in a decentralized network?
- How to describe and store the algorithms for data processing?
- How to authorize changes for large amounts of data?
- How can we verify state transitions?

## Goal

- Develop a taxonomy for a variety of decentralized data processing use cases
- Highlight the main algorithms for each use case
- List existing ipfs features or protocols that make an algorithm viable
- List what is missing

## Requirements to consider

Process data efficiently (low cost, low latency) in a permissionless network.

## Where to learn about it
